# MalariaCellsImageClassification
The Malaria Cells Image Classification project focuses on automating the diagnosis of malaria using deep learning techniques to classify microscopic images of blood cells.
Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, is a life-threatening disease that requires early and accurate detection. Traditionally, diagnosis is performed manually by pathologists who inspect blood smears under a microscope, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to address that challenge by building a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between infected (parasitized) and uninfected (healthy) red blood cells, thereby supporting faster and more reliable screening in medical settings.

The dataset used in this project was sourced from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), containing over 27,000 labeled images of parasitized and uninfected cells. To prepare the data, image preprocessing steps were applied, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation (flipping, rotation, and zooming), to enhance the diversity and quality of the training data while reducing overfitting. The core of the model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning architecture well-suited for image classification tasks due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data. The CNN was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, consisting of multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers followed by a softmax activation function to classify the input images into two categories.

The model was trained and validated using an 80:20 split, with categorical crossentropy as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer. Several evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The final model achieved over 95% accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating high effectiveness in identifying malaria-infected cells. The results indicate that the model could be potentially integrated into clinical decision support systems to assist healthcare professionals, especially in regions where expert diagnostic resources are limited.

This project not only enhanced my understanding of deep learning and image processing but also allowed me to apply these skills to a real-world healthcare problem with social impact. It reinforced the importance of technology in improving medical diagnostics and inspired me to explore further applications in the intersection of AI and healthcare.
